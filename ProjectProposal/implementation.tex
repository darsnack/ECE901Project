In order to perform an effective comparison between software implementations of CNNs and hardware implementations, we propose using TensorFlow, Amazon EC2, and Xilinx FPGAs. TensorFlow will be used to implement various software implementations of a given CNN structure for ImageNet. These CNN implementations will be trained and tested on Amazon EC2. A hardware implementation of the CNN will be created for Xilinx FPGAs in Vivado. Simulations will be performed to verify its functionality, and it will be deployed on a physical FPGA to test its timing characteristics and accuracy.
