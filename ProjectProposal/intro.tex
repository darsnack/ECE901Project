Machine learning systems tackle problems ranging from content filtering and recommender systems to object recognition and text classification.  Solving these problems involves finding classifiers that can detect patterns in input data.  In learning of deep neural networks, feature extraction is performed automatically by using many layers of representation; each layer involves passing inputs of the previous layer through a nonlinear activation function.  Compositions of successive layers can enable learning of classifiers corresponding to nonlinear decision boundaries, and this has led to recent successes in image classification and speech recognition.
