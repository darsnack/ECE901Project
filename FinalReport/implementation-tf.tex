A software implementation of a CNN was created in TensorFlow to serve as a baseline for comparison. In order for the network to fit on a single FPGA chip, we chose to only implement a simple, two-layer CNN. The structure for such a network is shown Fig. \ref{fig:cnn-structure}.

The TensorFlow implementations were trained using 12,800,000 samples using mini-batch stochastic gradient descent. We trained the model using Amazon EC2 spot instances with \code{c2x.large} (8-Core Xeon) and \code{c8x.large} (32-Core Xeon) processors.
