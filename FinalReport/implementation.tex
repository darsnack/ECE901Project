In order to perform an effective comparison between software implementations of CNNs and hardware implementations, we use TensorFlow, MATLAB, and Xilinx FPGAs. TensorFlow is used to train software implementations of a given CNN structure for CIFAR-10. These CNN implementations were trained and tested on a traditional CPU. A hardware implementation of the CNN has been created for Xilinx FPGAs in Vivado. Simulations have been performed to verify its functionality and collect timing characteristics, while an equivalent MATLAB model verifies its convergence.
